<h1>WV Population Density</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I utilize data structures in C to create functions including but not limited to getters, setters, proccessing input lines, and implementations of trim and substring. These functions serve to assist my deeper understanding of the population density issue in West Virginia, affecting taxes and infrastructure.
